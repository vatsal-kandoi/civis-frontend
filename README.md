# AngularStarterpack

This is an Angular Boilerplate that can be used to kickstart the development on any Angular project with speed. In the 4 years of working in a service industry, we have built numerous projects and accumulated a lot of learnings from them, that are baked into this boilerplate. Over time, we also noticed certain similarities that repeat themselves in all the projects. We did not necessarily have to re-invent the wheel everytime a new project was started. This boilerplate was all that we would need to get to writing the business logic of the project, the stuff that truly mattered. Using this boilerplate as the base for a project would also force devs to adopt a certian standard set by the boilerplate, thereby ensuring everyone is writing efficient, abstarcted and highly readable code!
